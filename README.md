Repository dedicated to **studying and practicing Haskell**.  
Focus is on mastering functional programming, type systems, and building composable, elegant solutions.

---

## STRUCTURE

- **Basics/** – syntax, functions, types, pattern matching  
- **FP/** – functional programming paradigms: higher-order functions, monads, functors  
- **DataStructures/** – implementation of data structures in Haskell (lists, trees, maps)  
- **Projects/** – small applications and explorations in Haskell  
- **Utils/** – reusable modules, helper functions and templates  

---

## OBJECTIVES

- Strengthen understanding of functional programming and Haskell idioms  
- Practice writing clean, composable, and type-safe code  
- Build a foundation for applications in data science, algorithms, and advanced concepts  

---

## ENVIRONMENT

- **Language:** Haskell  
- **Compiler / Tooling:** GHC, Stack, or Cabal  
- **Editor / IDE:** VS Code with Haskell extension, or any IDE of choice  
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)  

---

## CODE STYLE

- Code emphasizes **readability**, **type safety**, and **modularity**  
- Functions are composed and pure when possible  
- Naming follows Haskell community conventions: camelCase for functions, UpperCamelCase for types  
- Comments are used only when necessary to clarify complex logic
